# PHANTaSMA
**P**lataform of **H**igh-level **A**nalysis, **N**umerical **T**echniques **a**nd **S**ky **M**ap **A**pplications (PHANTaSMA)

Let's start with:

1. RMS maps smoother both in HEALPiX as cartesian
2. MCMC of simples SEDs
3. Classes with functions of the main radio-micro-submm components
4. Correct smoother and interpolator for maps.
5. Gaussian fit MCMC is useful
6. Esier code to do aperture photometry
